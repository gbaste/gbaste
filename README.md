<p>When I was 20 years old, a person I trusted offered me a job as a computer scientist without any experience, he only gave me one condition, a great desire to learn. That first year I discovered that technology was what I liked and what I wanted to dedicate myself to.</p>

Thanks to that first job I learned new technologies that allowed me to join other companies and continue to evolve in my career.

In the last company where I was, I was able to work giving support to Developers. That experience made me very interested in this world, so I decided to do the bootcamp at Skylab Coders, to specialize as a developer.

Thanks to this experience in the Bootcamp I have been able to translate my ideas into real projects, I have seen my most creative side grow, I have loved working in a team and sharing ideas on a daily basis, I have managed to manage my emotions in decisive moments and above all I have enjoyed learning and teaching as an assistant professor at Skylab Coders.
